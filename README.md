# 🌱 RL-Based Smart Irrigation System

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** based smart irrigation system using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**.
The goal is to **optimize water usage** while maintaining ideal soil moisture conditions for crops.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Maintain soil moisture in optimal range (40–60%)
* Minimize water usage
* Automate irrigation decisions using AI

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The system uses **Deep Reinforcement Learning**:

* **State (Environment Inputs):**

  * Soil Moisture
  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Rainfall
  * Time of Day

* **Actions:**

  * 0 → No water
  * 1 → Low water
  * 2 → Medium water
  * 3 → High water

* **Reward Function:**

  * Positive reward for optimal moisture
  * Penalty for overwatering or underwatering
  * Penalty for excessive water use
